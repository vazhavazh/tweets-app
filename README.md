## Application Functionality

The home page of the application displays a list of users with their tweets. Users can follow other users by clicking the "Follow" button. When the "Follow" button is clicked, it changes to "Following" and the number of followers increases by 1. The subscription state is preserved even after the page is refreshed.

The application also includes routing using React Router, allowing users to navigate between the home page and the tweets page.
